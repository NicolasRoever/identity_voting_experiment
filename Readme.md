# Structure of the Code

The main code is implemented in the survey folder. Here, there are the html files and one python file for functions, models, and pages. These are the standard files needed for otree pages. I also added a file python_functions, where I write functions needed for this survey. 


## Page: Political Opinions

This page asks for opinions on 9 different issues clearly ordered among conservative vs. liberal lines (see Enke et al., 2024). 
The participant can only click next, if all questions are answered.
