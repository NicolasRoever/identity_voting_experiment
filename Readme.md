# Structure of the Code

The main code is implemented in the survey folder. Here, there are the html files and one python file for functions, models, and pages. These are the standard files needed for otree pages. I also added a file python_functions, where I write functions needed for this survey. 


## Page: Political Opinions

This page asks for opinions on 9 different issues clearly ordered among conservative vs. liberal lines (see Enke et al., 2024). 
The participant can only click next, if all questions are answered. 



## To-Dos

- Make sure that you can deselct the radio buttons in the statement pages. 
- Make sure to randomize all conceivable question orders??????
- Program treatment and control and grouping. 
- Make all possible checks so that participants enter exactly what you want. 
- Check the thing on mobile devices.
- Check on different browsers. 
- Randomize the order of the politicians (this is another "treatment"), you need to make new videos here as well
- Think about the flow of the survey again. And about the mechanism question (just do what Enke does)
- Write the pre-analysis plan. 
- I have the problem in Primer, that the text is not redisplayed if there was an error. 
- Disable skipping the politician video 
- Change number color to be 100 in the mechanism question.
- Insert progress bar.
